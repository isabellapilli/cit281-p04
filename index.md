## PROJECT 3

```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain experience interpreting functional descriptions
   and specifications to complete an assignment
2. Gain experience breaking a project into manageable components
3. Gain experience writing and executing non-web server 
   Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
4. Practice creating and using code modules
5. Practice using modern JavaScript syntax
6. Gain experience writing and executing Node.js 
   REST API server using VSCode
7. Gain experience using Fastify with the GET
   verb, routes, and route parameters
8. Gain experience working with static data
9. Gain experience testing code module without using a web server
10. Gain experience using Postman to test web server routes
11. Gain experience working with JSON
12. Extra credit: Gain experience using Fastify 
    with POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs

Overview: 

You will be creating a REST API that works with a "data" source 
of questions and answers. You will create all of the code to work 
with the data source using a code module, and test the code module 
code using provided testing code. You will also create a Node.js 
REST API to handle the GET verb. 

```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal


### What I Learned:
In this project I was able to create a data file, a code module, and a web server. The data file held a 3 different question and answers, the code module had six different functions: *getQuestions(), getAnswers(), getQuestionsAnswers(), getQuestion(number = ""), getAnswer(number = ""),* and *getQuestionsAnswers(number = "")* which I tested using the *test()* function. I then created a REST API server which used a GET verb with 7 routes.
